Fractions (λεπτά)
The most usual was to express the denominator by the ordinary numeral with two accents affixed.
When the numerator was unity, and it was therefore simply a question of a symbol for a single word such as τρίτον, 1/3, there was no need to express the numerator,
symbol was γʹʹ; similarly $\text{ςʹʹ} = \frac{1}{6}$, $\text{ιεʹʹ} = \frac{1}{15}$, and so on.
When the numerator was not unity and a certain number of fourths, fifths, etc., had to be expressed, the ordinary numeral was used for the numerator;
thus $\text{θʹιαʹʹ} = \frac{9}{11}$, $\text{ιʹοαʹʹ} = \frac{10}{71}$.
In Heron's _Geometry_ the denominator was written twice in the latter class of fractions; thus $\frac{2}{5}$ (δύο πέμπτα) was βʹεʹʹεʹʹ,
$\frac{23}{33}$ (λεπτὰ τριακοστότριτα κγʹ or εἰκοσιτρία τριακοστότριτα) was κγʹλγʹʹλγʹʹ.
